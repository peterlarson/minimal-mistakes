**About me**

I am a Software Engineer currently living and working in New York, and passionate about solving problems with data. 

With my current role at Flatiron Health I have been able to work on several data-centric teams. On the Machine Learning team I was able to help develop data products. On the Clinical Trials team I was able to help use Flatiron's data to recruit more patients to clinical trials, and I currently am working on a team that helps cancer practices run insurance billing more efficiently. 

Before Flatiron I majored in Computer Science and Math at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. While I was there I studied for a year in Japan at the University of Aizu. I haven't maintained my Japanese well, but I have maintained an appreciation for Japanese food. 

Here is an interesting picture of me wearing springy stilts and inside a bubble at a Superhuman Sports Expo in Japan.
