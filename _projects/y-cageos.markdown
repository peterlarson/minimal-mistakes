For my operating systems class sophomore year, I worked with a team to create a basic operating system. We spent some time trying to come up with a fun theme, and decided to make it Nicholas Cage themed, and added some ASCII art of the actor.

To do this we renamed our shell> prompt cage>, and we included some ascii art. The startup screen is shown above. It was a fun project to learn about operating systems, ASCII art, and the collected works of Mr. Cage.  

The operating system also had some more traditional features. A full version of it running in a javascript emulator can be seen <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cageOS"> here </a>.
