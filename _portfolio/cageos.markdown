For my operating systems class sophmore year me and a team created an operating system. Ours was special because it was Nick Cage themed. 

To do this we renamed our shell> prompt cage>, and we included some ascii art. The startup screen is shown above. It was a fun project to learn about operating systems, ascii art, and the collected works of Mr. Cage.  

The operating system also had some more traditional features. A full version of it running in a javascript emulator can be seen <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cageOS"> here </a>.
